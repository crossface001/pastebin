# pastebin
an open-source website similar to [pastebin.com](https://pastebin.com) where you can store any piece of code, and generate links for easy sharing.
However, what makes this pastebin special is that it works with no database, and no back-end code. Instead, the data is compressed and stored entirely in the link that you share, nowhere else!
